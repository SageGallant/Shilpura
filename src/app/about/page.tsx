                The Shilpura Journey
              </h2>
              <p className="text-osloGray mb-6">
                Shilpura was born from a deep appreciation for the beauty and
                significance of handcraft traditions around the world. Our
                founder, Maya Patel, spent years traveling to remote villages
                and urban workshops, witnessing firsthand the incredible skill
                of artisans and the challenges they face in a rapidly changing
                global market.
              </p>
              <p className="text-osloGray mb-6">
                The name "Shilpura" combines "shilp" (craft in Sanskrit) with
                "pura" (city or community), reflecting our vision of creating a
                global community centered around craft. We believe that
                handcrafted objects carry stories, cultural significance, and
                human connection that mass-produced items simply cannot match.
              </p>
              <p className="text-osloGray">
                Founded in 2024, Shilpura bridges the gap between skilled
                artisans and conscious consumers who value authenticity,
                quality, and ethical production. We're more than a
                marketplaceâ€”we're a platform for preserving cultural heritage,
                supporting sustainable livelihoods, and celebrating the beauty
                of handmade.

                positive impact we create for artisan communities and the
                environment. Through fair partnerships and sustainable
                practices, we're helping to preserve craft traditions that might

              <p className="text-osloGray mb-4">
                Our partnerships currently support artisans in 12 countries
                across 4 continents, with a focus on regions where traditional
                crafts are at risk. Many of our partner artisans report
                increased income and improved working conditions, allowing them
                to support their families while continuing their craft
                traditions.

              <p className="text-osloGray mb-6">
                By prioritizing sustainable materials and practices, we're also
                reducing the environmental footprint of our products compared to
                mass-produced alternatives. We believe that traditional craft
                often inherently embraces sustainability, using local, natural
                materials and time-tested techniques that minimize waste.
